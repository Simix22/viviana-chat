🔧 FIX FOR ADMIN PANEL - "Total Users: 0" Issue
================================================

PROBLEM:
Admin panel shows "Total Users: 0" even though you created an account.

SOLUTION - Follow these steps:

Step 1: Open Debug Tool
-----------------------
1. Open this file in your browser:
   C:\Users\yanaa\.claude\website\debug.html

2. You will see all your localStorage data

3. Check the "Registered Users" section:
   - If it shows 0 users, click "🔧 Fix Admin Panel" button
   - If it shows 1+ users, the data is there

Step 2: Check Browser Console
------------------------------
1. Open admin.html in browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Click "Console" tab
4. Login with admin/admin123
5. Look for console messages starting with "=== LOADING ADMIN DATA ==="
6. This will show you EXACTLY what data is being loaded

Step 3: Test Complete Flow
---------------------------
1. Open index.html
2. Create a NEW account with different email (e.g., test@example.com)
3. Open admin.html in SAME browser (new tab)
4. Login as admin
5. You should now see the user!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- Admin panel and user app MUST be in the SAME browser
- LocalStorage is per-browser (Chrome data ≠ Firefox data)
- If you switch browsers, you need to recreate accounts
- Using "Clear All Data" in debug.html will delete everything

QUICK TEST:
-----------
1. Open debug.html - check if users exist
2. If NO users: Open index.html and signup
3. Refresh debug.html - should now show 1 user
4. Open admin.html - should now show 1 total user

The admin panel has been updated with MORE debugging logs.
Check the browser console (F12) to see detailed information!
